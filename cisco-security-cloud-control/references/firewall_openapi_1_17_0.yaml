The operation returns a transaction object that can be used to track the progress of the onboarding operation. Note: Zero-Touch Onboarding can be done with Secure Firewall 1xxx, 2xxx, and 3xxx Series devices. This operation will be marked as complete once CDO is ready to handle a response from the device once it is plugged in and connected to the Internet; it does not wait for the device to communicate back to Security Cloud Control.'
